# Daniel Cruz - Porfolio

Hello üñêüèΩ, I'm Daniel Cruz, a Frontend developer focused on React library and Javascript technologies. I'm working on this new portfolio to show you my progress with different technologies like **React.js**, **Next.js**, **Typescript**, **Javascript in client side** (vanilla) and **Javascript in server side** (Express). And applied concepts like conventional commits, code conventions, composition, REST API's consuming and clean code.

In future, I'll add new content like personal projects or features like a CMS blog site...I'm still thinking about it üòâ.

**When the site will be deployed, I leave the link in this README**

## Getting Started

Hello, only clone the repository and download the dependencies by npm command, then start the development server with the script **"dev"** as shown below:

```bash
$ npm i

$ npm run dev
# or
$ yarn dev
```

### If you want use conventional commits, I use commitizen

Only execute the next command with Node.js version 12.x

```bash
$ npx cz
```
